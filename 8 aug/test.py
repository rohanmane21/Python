# Certainly, here are a few questions related to nested dictionaries in Python that you can use for practice or testing your knowledge:

# 1. *Accessing Nested Dictionary Values:*
#    Given the following nested dictionary, how would you access the value `"Grapes"`?
#    python
#    fruits = {
#        "fruits1": {
#            "apple": 3,
#            "banana": 5,
#            "cherry": 10
#        },
#        "fruits2": {
#            "orange": 8,
#            "grapes": 15,
#            "kiwi": 6
#        }
#    }
   

# 2. *Adding a Key-Value Pair to Nested Dictionary:*
#    How can you add the key `"pear"` with the value `7` to the `"fruits1"` sub-dictionary in the above `fruits` dictionary?

# 3. *Updating Values in a Nested Dictionary:*
#    If you want to change the value of `"banana"` in `"fruits1"` to `8`, how would you do it?

# 4. *Iterating Through Nested Dictionary:*
#    Write a loop to iterate through the `fruits` dictionary and print the name of each fruit along with its quantity.

# 5. *Checking if a Key Exists:*
#    How can you check if the key `"watermelon"` exists in the `"fruits2"` sub-dictionary of the `fruits` dictionary?

# 6. *Removing a Key-Value Pair:*
#    If you want to remove the `"kiwi"` key from the `"fruits2"` sub-dictionary, how would you achieve this?

# 7. *Creating a New Nested Dictionary:*
#    Create a new nested dictionary named `student_data` containing information about a student's name, age, and subjects with their corresponding grades. For example:
#    python
#    student_data = {
#        "name": "John Doe",
#        "age": 18,
#        "subjects": {
#            "math": 85,
#            "science": 92,
#            "history": 78
#        }
#    }
   

# 8. *Extracting Nested Dictionary Information:*
#    From the `student_data` dictionary created in the previous question, how would you extract John Doe's grade in the subject "science"?

# 9. *Adding Nested Dictionaries Dynamically:*
#    How can you dynamically add a new subject `"english"` with a grade of `88` to the `student_data` dictionary?

# 10. *Counting Nested Dictionary Elements:*
#     Write a Python code snippet to count the total number of subjects in the `student_data` dictionary.

# Feel free to use these questions for practice, testing your understanding of nested dictionaries in Python, or as part of quizzes or exercises
